Vid2Sim is a novel framework that converts monocular videos into photorealistic and physically interactive simulation environments for training embodied agents with minimal sim-to-real gap.

## 🎥 Reconstruct the simulation envs from videos
Vid2Sim transforms monocular videos into simulation environments by reconstructing the scene geometry and appearance. The generated environments preserve real-world diversity and visual fidelity, providing minimal sim-to-real gap for agent training.


👉 To get started, follow the reconstruction guide in [vid2sim_recon](src/vid2sim_recon/README.md) to reconstruct the simulation environment from video.

## 🤖 Train the Agent in Real-to-Sim Environments

After the environment is reconstructed, Vid2Sim translates the real-to-sim environments into a interactive environment with both realistic visual appearance and physical collision to train the agent in diverse situations.

👉 To set up the environment and launch RL training, refer to [vid2sim_rl](src/vid2sim_rl/README.md).

## 📚 Vid2Sim Dataset

The Vid2Sim dataset includes 30 high-quality real-to-sim simulation environments reconstructed from video clips sourced from 9 web videos. Each clip includes 15 seconds of forward-facing video recorded at 30 fps, providing 450 frames per scene for environment reconstruction and simulation.  

We provide the source [video data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jGmKxZL6hKvjCg6qhM9wmW1_HjMwCUGa?usp=sharing), and [interactive Unity environments](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LCruqb6M3mCgsjaqI1ON6WVoZ-9CmQDY?usp=sharing) for agent training.
